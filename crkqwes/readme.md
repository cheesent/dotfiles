This keymap supports spanish and english, I use both

To do:
- Add better oled functionality
- mouse control functionality on keyboard, before I used warpd now with wayland I can't. Getting it to work on keyboard could be nice.

- 

Some features
- vim like gestures on the arrow keys
- quick media control
- screenshots
- Tilde (Â´) and the ' thing (symbols layout)
